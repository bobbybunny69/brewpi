# BrewPi (experimental)
This is my personal python code for a BrewPi home brewing controller.  It is based of pygame and uses MDI Icons, to create a graphical interface on a Raspberry Pi (I used a 3B+) and the standard 7" touch screen display (800x480).  

Spec: 
* Rpi board individually powered? 
* 4 temp sensors and 4 mains outputs controlled by relays 
*    Show on display 4 temps (or disconn/err) 
*    Select which temp drives heating controller 
*    Pumps manually switched on display 
*    Heating override 
*    Logging of data 
*    Exporting to Home Assistant 
*    Control via Brewfather
